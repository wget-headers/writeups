# Writeup for Perfect Match X-treme

The challange was to complete a mini game in a "bootleg" fall guys unity game.
however the game was technically impossible to beat since all the platforms at the end of the game gets removed.

i suspected that the flag must be stored in memory or in strings in the game files somwhere.
to not go through the hassle of some "ecnryption" methods, i decided to inspect the memory of the game while its running.

with cheat engine i opned up the memory and did a text search for `SEKAi{` and found
`SEKAI{F4LL_GUY5_` so searching around more i found the rest:

`SEKAI{F4LL_GUY5_H3CK_15_1LL3G4L}`
